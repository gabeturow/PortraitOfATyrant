The Captain's ledger? Where did you find this?

BRIANA
In his quarters. I fled there in the attack, sir.
From what I've gathered, his patrols have hurt your international business quite badly...
It makes sense, since he's managed to

Grievance # 1
Cut off our Trade with all parts of the world./PROSPERITY

BRIANA
Dudingston has cut off our trade with all parts of the world. 

CON/PLAYDEC/Declaration/0

THE AMERICAN
It's true! And we won't stand for it anymore!
Our petitions to stop Dudingston's ships went unanswered, so maybe they'll listen now! 
You should join us. Big things are on the horizon. 

BRIANA
I'm flattered, but no. I have a score to settle with the Captain. 
If you'll excuse me, time is of the essence.

THE AMERICAN
More than you know! 
If you intend to reach the Captain, you'll have to navigate through my men posted about the ship.
They won't be as kind as I have been...
And you'll want to avoid our fires. They're beginning on the upperdeck right now. 
And now you may pass. God speed, child!

BRIANA
Dudingston has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country...

THE AMERICAN
Dudingston has pressed many into service, but that's not our complaint with him today!
His ruthlessness concerns our prosperity more than our liberty, my dear!

BRIANA
Right, right, right. Of course.
What I meant was, as his assault on our prosperity has accelerated, he has:

Grievance # 3
Endeavored to prevent the population of these States…/PROSPERITY

BRIANA
Dudingston has endeavored to prevent the population of these States...

THE AMERICAN
You know, I really don't believe Dudingston is so concerned with immigration. 
The man seems to focus on enforcing the King's taxes on molasses and other products.

BRIANA
Right, right, right. Of course.
What I meant was, as his assault on our prosperity has accelerated, he has:

Grievance # 4
Quartered large bodies of armed troops among us./PEACE

BRIANA
Dudingston has quartered large bodies of armed troops among us.

THE AMERICAN
I'm sure he's considered stationing some of his squadrons in town, but that hasn't been a problem so far.
It's his actions at sea that worry us...

BRIANA
Right, right, right. Of course.
What I meant was, as his assault on our prosperity has accelerated, he has:
