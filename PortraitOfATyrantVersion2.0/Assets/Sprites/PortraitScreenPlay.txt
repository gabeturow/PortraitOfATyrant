CAPTAIN DUDINGSTON
Get back!I remind you, you are still my property!
The King’s Letter of Marque gives me authority over you.

SOUND EFFECT

BRIANA
No, sir!
You should be ashamed. 
You are a legalized pirate who relies almost entirely on forced labor.
It would be one thing if you did your own dirty work, but instead you make us do it for you.
Day in and day out you have:

Grievance # 1
Cut off our Trade with all parts of the world./PROSPERITY


BRIANA
You have cut off our trade with all parts of the world.

CAPTAIN DUDINGSTON
It's true I've done my best to cut of their shipping lanes, but I believe you were getting at something else...
Something to do with why you find it so unjust to work for me...

BRIANA
Hmmmm.

CHOICES


Grievance # 2
Constrained your fellow Citizens, taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country…/LIBERTY


BRIANA
You have constrained your fellow Citizens, taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country...
To become the Executioners of their Friends and Brethren, or to Fall themselves by their Hands.

SOUND EFFECT
VICTORY!

CAPTAIN DUDINGSTON
Well gosh, it sounds so dramatic when you put it that way.

BRIANA
Do not mock me! 
I will use the momentum from your downfall to advocate for a new right...
A right that guards against such cynical invasions of our liberty and property:

Right # 1
Right to trial by jury in civil cases./PROSPERITY


BRIANA
Right to trial by jury in civil cases.

CAPTAIN DUDINGSTON
And how would that protect you from trade violations and impressment? I'm confused...

BRIANA
Indeed! I misspoke. Excuse me.
To stop your hostile assertion of dominance in our seas, we must cultivate a new defense:

RIGHTS


Right # 2
No quartering of soldiers in one's house./PROSPERITY


BRIANA
You need a new right:
No quartering of soldiers in one's house.

CAPTAIN DUDINGSTON
The housing for my soldiers is not your concern.
I can already see why stationing them in your town might be intimidating for some people...

BRIANA
Indeed! I misspoke. Excuse me.
To stop your hostile assertion of dominance in our seas, we must cultivate a new defense:

RIGHTS


Right # 3
Freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures./PROSPERITY


BRIANA
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.

SOUND EFFECT
VICTORY!

CAPTAIN DUDINGSTON
Blast it!
As I listen to you, and watch these blokes light my ship on fire...
I have to wonder if I've gone astray.
But then again, if my work disturbed their slaving and endless profits, well, it was probably worth it. 
The privateer's life's for me, it seems! 
You, on the other hand, should now make haste to the front of the ship and save yourself...
It is time that my dear Gaspée faces her maker...

Right # 4
Freedom from excessive bail, cruel and unusual punishments./PROSPERITY


BRIANA
Freedom from excessive bail, and cruel and unusual punishment. 

CAPTAIN DUDINGSTON
I don't see how that would help you with your current problems, my dear.
You haven't been imprisoned or tried in court.

BRIANA
Indeed! I misspoke. Excuse me.
To stop your hostile assertion of dominance in our seas, we must cultivate a new defense:




RIGHTS


Grievance # 3
Deprived us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury./JUSTICE


BRIANA
You have deprived us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury.

CAPTAIN DUDINGSTON
That is false! I haven't denied anyone a fair trial! 
Besides, everything I do is perfectly legal. Haven't you seen my letter of Marque?

BRIANA
Hmmmm.

CHOICES


Grievance # 4
Quartered large bodies of armed troops among us./PEACE


BRIANA
You have quartered large bodies of armed troops among us.

CAPTAIN DUDINGSTON
I personally need my men out at sea, 
but what did you expect of my fellow Brits, who defend the colonies from aggression at every turn? 
That we'd sail back to England after every conflict, and just wait for something new to go wrong back here? 
It's so much easier to use the buildings in your towns,
and live off of your generous gifts of food and other supplies. 
But you were talking about something else, weren't you?

BRIANA
Hmmmm.
